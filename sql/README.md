## Dupe DB
As the cost of living continues to rise, more cosmetics consumers have been trying to spend less money and are instead choosing 'dupes' â€“ beauty products that emulate more expensive counterparts at a much more affordable price.

The objective of the Dupe DB project is to create a Relational Database that will help to organize dupes and also provide a foundation for a web-based application where consumers can search through existing dupes and also suggest new dupes based on their own experience.
