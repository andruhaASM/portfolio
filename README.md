# Portfolio
Brings together code snippets and small projects to showcase my technical skills as a Backend Software Engineer.

# How to navigate
Pay attention to the directories' names. They should give you some clue to evaluate my ability to give good names to my project's dirs.

Inside each directory you should find a `README` file (not 100% guaranteed) that contains the detailed description of the dir's content.
